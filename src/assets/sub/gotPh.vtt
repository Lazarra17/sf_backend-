00:00:04.652 --> 00:00:06.681
There was a raven
from King's Landing.

00:00:06.956 --> 00:00:09.758
<v Mary>No way!Jon Arryn is dead.

00:00:09.793 --> 00:00:11.727
<i>The King rides</i>
<i>for Winterfell</i>

00:00:11.761 --> 00:00:14.229
<i>with the Queen</i>
<i>and all the rest of them.</i>

00:00:14.264 --> 00:00:16.331
<i>The Queen</i>
<i>has two brothers?</i>

00:00:16.366 --> 00:00:19.701
There's the pretty one,
and there's the clever one.

00:00:19.736 --> 00:00:21.870
I would name you
the Hand of the King.

00:00:21.905 --> 00:00:23.639
We were meant
to rule together.

00:00:23.673 --> 00:00:28.143
<i>I have a son, you have a daughter.</i>
<i>We'll join our houses.</i>

00:00:28.178 --> 00:00:30.879
The boy I beheaded--
he was talking madness.

00:00:30.914 --> 00:00:32.948
Said the others
slaughtered his friends.

00:00:32.982 --> 00:00:35.551
- Ned: A Wildling ambush.
- Maybe.

00:00:35.585 --> 00:00:36.961
You're Tyrion Lannister.

00:00:36.986 --> 00:00:39.279
You-- you're Ned Stark's
bastard, aren't you?

00:00:39.522 --> 00:00:41.590
Let me give you
some advice, bastard.

00:00:41.624 --> 00:00:44.793
Never forget what you are and it
can never be used to hurt you.

00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.000
